# External Penetration Test

## Mapping Attack Surface

### Automated Tools
- [ ] Generate nmap output files (with targets in `targets.txt`):
    ```sh
    nmap -oA nmap-out -sV -p- -vv -iL targets.txt
    ```
- [ ] For tests with lots of web hosts, grab screenshots with a tool like [gowitness](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness)
- [ ] Import nmap findings into Metasploit
    ```sh
    # create a new workspace
    workspace -a <target name>
    
    # import the file
    db_import nmap-out.xml
    
    # view 5060 and 2000 to see if they are legit (they probably are not)
    services -p 5060,2000
    
    # delete them
    services -p 5060,2000 -d
    ```
- [ ] Use Metasploit modules for web dir/file enumeration
    ```sh
    msfconsole
    spool dir-scanner.txt
    use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner
    set DICTIONARY /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
    
    services -u -p 80 --rhosts
    set rport 80
    set ssl false
    run
    
    services -u -p 443 --rhosts
    set rport 443
    set ssl true
    run
    
    # repeat for other web ports (8443, 8080, etc)
    ```

### Manual Review
- [ ] Identify all URLs that allow logins from Spiderfoot.
- [ ] Review all the discovered URLs from the Metasploit dir scanners.
- [ ] Identify all systems that may provide remote access (Citrix, RDP, VPN, etc).
- [ ] Identify all vendor-products that are likely to offer RCE-as-a-feature (Jenkins, Serv-U, etc).
- [ ] Identify all vendor products that may allow you to download a trial version to look for 0-days.

## Obtaining Credentials

### Password Spraying
- [ ] Make damn sure you know the lockout policy you are up against.
- [ ] Do you have reliable username enumeration on an endpoint? OWA, Skype, etc.
    - If so, do a fine-tuned first run with usernames from OSINT phase PLUS as much from the [likely usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) as you have time for.
- [ ] Spray a service accounts list like [this one](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames/blob/master/service-accounts.txt) with username-as-password.
- [ ] Spray your known-good corporate usernames against common passwords, staying safely below lockout rates.
    - [The classics](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames/blob/master/weak-corporate-passwords/english-basic.txt)
    - SeasonYear (Summer2019)
    - MonthYear (March2019)
    - CompanyNumber (Google1)
    - CompanyYear (Google2019)
    - ^^ All of the above without a capital first letter, and a `!` at the end (still meets complexity requirements)
    - ^^ All of the above with a `!` at the end.
    - No luck? Get creative with things like the corporate HQ address, corporate mottos, etc.
- [ ] Still no creds and safe to try more without locking out? Try weak passwords based on company name, location, etc.

## Authenticated Information Gathering
- [ ] Gather all user accounts from:
    - OWA or Office365 address list
    - portal.azure.com (Azure AD)
    - Lync (Windows app will download and cache the GAL locally)
- [ ] Search email inboxes for:
    - "Password" - look for standard password IT uses to reset
    - "Remote Access" - look for info on connecting to VPN, etc
    - "Intranet", "Portal", "HelpDesk", etc - look for sources of internal company info
- [ ] Hang out in company chat rooms in Slack, Skype, etc.
- [ ] Check calendars for dial in info for board meetings and other sensitive events.
- [ ] Check Office365, Sharepoint, Drive, etc for similar sensitive details.
- [ ] Try additional password spraying with new accounts and likely passwords you have gathered.

## Breaching the Perimeter

- [ ] Leverage all available remote access services, such as:
    - RDP
    - Citrix
    - VPN
- [ ] Identified any RCE-by-design apps during OSINT? Try the credentials on those.
- [ ] Look for trial versions of any off-the-shelf applications on perimeter, download, find 0 days.
