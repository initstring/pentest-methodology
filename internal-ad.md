# Internal Penetration Test (Active Directory Environments)

## Unauthenticated Information Gathering

### Automated Tools
- [ ] Generate nmap output files (with targets in `targets.txt`):
    ```sh
    nmap -oA nmap-out -sV -p- -vv -iL targets.txt
    ```
- [ ] For tests with lots of web hosts, grab screenshots with a tool like [gowitness](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness)
- [ ] Import nmap findings into Metasploit
    ```sh
    # create a new workspace
    workspace -a <target name>
    
    # import the file
    db_import nmap-out.xml
    
    # view 5060 and 2000 to see if they are legit (they probably are not)
    services -p 5060,2000
    
    # delete them
    services -p 5060,2000 -d
    ```
- [ ] Use Metasploit modules for web dir/file enumeration
    ```sh
    msfconsole
    spool dir-scanner.txt
    use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner
    set DICTIONARY /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
    
    services -u -p 80 --rhosts
    set rport 80
    set ssl false
    run
    
    services -u -p 443 --rhosts
    set rport 443
    set ssl true
    run
    
    # repeat for other web ports (8443, 8080, etc)
    ```
- [ ] Check for anonymous SMB shares with `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares`.
- [ ] Check for open NFS shares with `auxiliary/scanner/nfs/nfsmount`.
- [ ] Check for anonymous FTP shares with `auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous`.
- [ ] Create a list of machines that are not configured to do SMB signing (for relaying later on).
    - crackmapexec '--gen-relay-list'

### Manual Review
- [ ] Identify all URLs that allow logins.
- [ ] Manually review screenshots from all HTTP services.


## Obtaining Credentials
- [ ] Responder attack.
    - First, run in analyze mode. Determine blue-teamy stuff and then run configure Responder.conf to not respond to those IPs.
- [ ] Execute an [ipv6 mitm](https://github.com/fox-it/mitm6) attack.
- [ ] Getting action from standard responder or mitm6? Use [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)'s ntlmrelay.py to dump SAM and/or get interactive SMB shells.
- [ ] Start cracking any received challenge/response data.
- [ ] Wireless WPA-Enterprise attacks to gather usernames, hashes, and passwords.
    - [airgeddon](https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon) is a nice automation tool for hostapd-wpe.
- [ ] Find any printer admin pages? Try default creds and look for LDAP integration.
- [ ] Drop a few USB sticks in the conference rooms (don't push the scope!).
- [ ] Internal password spray:
    - Metasploit's `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login`.
    - [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec).
    

## Authenticated Information Gathering
- [ ] Manually review scripts in `\\domain_name\netlogon`
    - Don't just look for passwords - look for references to dev environments, deployment servers, etc.
- [ ] Run the [Sharphound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound) injestor and map paths in Bloodhound.
- [ ] Enumerate shares with crackmapexec '--shares'
- [ ] Rummage through shares.
- [ ] Rummage through Sharepoint, e-mail, etc.
    - [ ] Look for anything related to new accounts and passwords resets. IT often uses standard passwords for these. If you find one, spray it around.
- [ ] Enumerate and map network connectivity with a tool like [leprechaun](https://blog.vonahi.io/post-exploitation-with-leprechaun/).


## Initial Foothold
- [ ] 

## Local Privilege Escalation
- [ ] Try [WindowsEnum](https://github.com/absolomb/WindowsEnum) or similar script to cover the basics.
- [ ] Use a test machine to observe procmon.exe for vendor 0-days (writable DLL and service paths, etc)

## Domain Privilege Escalation
- [ ] Get SPNs (Kerberoast - get that GPU humming!)
- [ ] Run [Grouper](https://github.com/l0ss/Grouper2)
- [ ] Running SQL servers? Try for authenticated SQL/SMB relay with `auxiliary/admin/mssql/mssql_ntlm_stealer`
- [ ] Leverage existing credentials to get more credentials or passable hashes.
    - crackmapexec '--sam'
    - crackmapexec '--lsa'
    - crackmapexec '-M mimikatz'
    - Windows Task Manager or procdump.exe to dump lsass and use mimikatz or [pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz)
- [ ] Find logged in users  and sessions on boxes you have admin rights to.
    - crackmapexec '--loggedon-users'
    - crackmapexec '--sessions'
- [ ] Review Bloodhound path's to DA with:
    - All currently compromised accounts
    - All logged-on users on boxes you have admin rights to


## Objective Hunting
- [ ] Use Impacket's secretsdump.py to access credentials for specific accounts you need.
